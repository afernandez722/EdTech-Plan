# Robert Peary Middle School Educational Technology Plan

![Robert Peary Middle School !](https://schoolmint-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/explorelausd/upload/pi8rvp_IMG_0090.jpg "Robert Peary Middle School")

####
The purpose of this educational plan is to provide my school and I a fighting chance into the computer science world. I want to learn as much as I can to then bring it to my classroom. Then, impact my school and overall making a difference in the community one classroom at a time.

## Situation

Serving grade level 6-8, Robert Peary Middle School has not have a computer science elective for many years. This school has had before computer classes where students learn the basics of computers. They learn how to e-mail, use software from their chromebooks, and learn how to type on a keyboard. This school use to have MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science,and Achievement) club. This program provided the opportunity to go through the engineering process in which they competed with other schools. Project such as prosthetic arm, glider, and presentation of the digestion system. These are only to name a few of the projects. In addition, there was the opportunity for students to also code using arduinos to attach to the prosthetic arms. This program no longer exist in this school but one day it shall return.

The school also had a program with USC where students teamed up to discuss robotics. This school year we have changed our schedule. Students are given 4 classes for 10 weeks. This gives students more opportunities to take more elective classes. Students who have been in computer science for the first mester will return to third mester computer science elective. 

Another constraint that is arising as the school year is unfolding is the lack of repair for the chromebooks. Students are given this technological devices but are not taught how to take care of the devices. Students find themselves breaking the devices could because they are in their backpacks. Other students have the problem where they do not feel 100% accountable about the computer and when others are borrowing their device they do not care how that other student cares for the device. Thus, a key or screen will be either missing or broken. The school response to this is that the student is responsible for repain. This of course is not done right away or at all resulting in the student without a device. 

Student's demographic shown below has show that there are gaps to access to technology. From the lock down because of covid, there was a lot of evidence to suggest that are student's home do not have access to computer and broadband internet at home. Hot spots were provided and iPads/ Chromebooks were passed out to students who had some one to drive them and help check out these devices. A lot of these students were not even in the state of California or even in the country. There is definitely a degital divide among my students. 

## Context

###### Location
Robert Peary Middle School students are with in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The school is with the city of Gardena, which is within south bay California. It is also within Los Angeles County.

### Description
#### Course name COMPUTER SCI DISCOVERY A/B
#### Grade Level 7th

The course will be in a 10 week time frame because our school has moved to a schedule called 4 by 4. That will give students the chance to have more elective choices and less classes to participate in a short period of time. Students will receive 20 weeks total of computer science in a course of one school year. 

### Application

First 10 weeks of this school year long  course

Students are given the chance to work in Code.org and MIT Scratch. In [Code.org](https://code.org), students create a website and learned to code with angry bird characters. Through this free resource students learned basics on how to create tags for HTML. Students were also given the chance to learn how to code angry birds to send them to different locations to then complete tasks. With both of these programs students were given the chance to practice pair programming. Pair program is a evidence based research practice that code.org has emphasized in their curriculum. It is also part of their web based software. This is when students can work with a partner and actually choose their parner's name for the class roster in code.org. Code.org also has other problems students can learn basic task of coding and it provides instant feedback when students have an error in their code. This software also gives me the access to check progress. Students are evaluated and moved on to the next step of the lesson. I plan to use this progress report from code.org to then to give students participation points of completion of task on LMS Schoology.

  In [MIT Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), students were given different task to complete. These tasks were projects were like [Make a game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=chase-game), students are given a tutorial on how to make a game that will have them chase a character to to score points. There are also projects brought to you by youtube. Such projects are like [the catch game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NN5v2wSL4U). Teaches students step by step on how to set up the code on catching falling objects. It teaches students how to use graphical planes to determine quadrants of x and y axis.
  
Next 10 weeks
  Next time meeting with te students will be using program called [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com). This program has students work with objects that will give them 3D movement of the object but online. Students use this online program to then download their project to upload the saved file to [Ultimaker](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura). Students should have downloaded this software to their computer. This application is called Cura. This is the program that talks to the 3D printer machine. 
  
  Lastly, students will be using a [canvasworkspace](https://canvasworkspace.brother.com/en) to work with vinyl/adhesive cutter. They will use this to design products to bring awareness to local or worldwide issues. This cutter uses an online program to have students type and design logos and text to print out in either an adhesive medium or vinyl to then adhere to other cloth like material. 

### Impacts

This will help out students computer science implements critical thinking skills that students may not have or need help building on it. Students at my school do not have a lot of opportunities for trial an error. The first offense is taken and shut down. My students need multiple chances to make mistakes and speak their mind. Though it is difficult in a school system that castigates them for things that they were not taught otherwise. I know this new knowledge would be difficult and weird to them because it is not something they are use to doing. Even as an educator it will have be break out of my comfort level and actually let students lead their education. The only reason I don’t do this because I feel I won’t know how to lead them to where they want to go. I am not sure how to cultivate class resiliency. I am not even sure how that would even look like.

# Robert Peary Middle School Educational Technology Plan

![Robert Peary Middle School !](https://schoolmint-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/explorelausd/upload/pi8rvp_IMG_0090.jpg "Robert Peary Middle School")

####
The purpose of this educational plan is to provide my school and I a fighting chance into the computer science world. I want to learn as much as I can to then bring it to my classroom. Then, impact my school and overall making a difference in the community one classroom at a time.

## Situation

Serving grade level 6-8, Robert Peary Middle School has not have a computer science elective for many years. This school has had before computer classes where students learn the basics of computers. They learn how to e-mail, use software from their chromebooks, and learn how to type on a keyboard. This school use to have MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science,and Achievement) club. This program provided the opportunity to go through the engineering process in which they competed with other schools. Project such as prosthetic arm, glider, and presentation of the digestion system. These are only to name a few of the projects. In addition, there was the opportunity for students to also code using arduinos to attach to the prosthetic arms. This program no longer exist in this school but one day it shall return.

The school also had a program with USC where students teamed up to discuss robotics. This school year we have changed our schedule. Students are given 4 classes for 10 weeks. This gives students more opportunities to take more elective classes. Students who have been in computer science for the first mester will return to third mester computer science elective. 

Another constraint that is arising as the school year is unfolding is the lack of repair for the chromebooks. Students are given this technological devices but are not taught how to take care of the devices. Students find themselves breaking the devices could because they are in their backpacks. Other students have the problem where they do not feel 100% accountable about the computer and when others are borrowing their device they do not care how that other student cares for the device. Thus, a key or screen will be either missing or broken. The school response to this is that the student is responsible for repain. This of course is not done right away or at all resulting in the student without a device. 

Student's demographic shown below has show that there are gaps to access to technology. From the lock down because of covid, there was a lot of evidence to suggest that are student's home do not have access to computer and broadband internet at home. Hot spots were provided and iPads/ Chromebooks were passed out to students who had some one to drive them and help check out these devices. A lot of these students were not even in the state of California or even in the country. There is definitely a degital divide among my students. 

## Context

### Description
#### Course name COMPUTER SCI DISCOVERY A/B
#### Grade Level 7th

The course will be in a 10 week time frame because our school has moved to a schedule called 4 by 4. That will give students the chance to have more elective choices and less classes to participate in a short period of time. Students will receive 20 weeks total of computer science in a course of one school year. 

### Application

First 10 weeks of this school year long  course

Students are given the chance to work in Code.org and MIT Scratch. In [Code.org](https://code.org), students create a website and learned to code with angry bird characters. Through this free resource students learned basics on how to create tags for HTML. Students were also given the chance to learn how to code angry birds to send them to different locations to then complete tasks. With both of these programs students were given the chance to practice pair programming. Pair program is a evidence based research practice that code.org has emphasized in their curriculum. It is also part of their web based software. This is when students can work with a partner and actually choose their parner's name for the class roster in code.org. Code.org also has other problems students can learn basic task of coding and it provides instant feedback when students have an error in their code. This software also gives me the access to check progress. Students are evaluated and moved on to the next step of the lesson. I plan to use this progress report from code.org to then to give students participation points of completion of task on LMS Schoology. As for creating a website, students are also given the chance to pair program and find errors in code to help learn together. There are assignments that give students code for a website and students find the tags that are missing to make the function of that tag work properly. code.org gives them instant feedback and also helpful resources to know how the tag should look like.

  In [MIT Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), students were given different task to complete. These tasks were projects like [Make a game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=chase-game), students are given a tutorial on how to make a game that will have them chase a character to to score points. There are also projects brought to you by youtube. Such projects are like [the catch game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NN5v2wSL4U). Teaches students step by step on how to set up the code on catching falling objects. It teaches students how to use graphical planes to determine quadrants of x and y axis. I would present students with the video showing them the basic steps to creating the project. Then students work on the project. After they are finished students are asked to remix their own project. This is when students go back to their basic code and either build on or modify to make it different from originally completed. There is also another project where students create a story on scratch. Using this project idea, students can then do peer instruction were students work with a group of students to show and receive feedback from peers on the progress of their work. This could be done multiple times for some students who may or may not need extra help. In the end, students present their final project to the whole class. The class provides feedback and so does the teacher. Final project and completion of the project is used as evaluation of their skills in scratch.
  
Next 10 weeks
  Next time meeting with te students will be using program called [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com). This program has students work with objects that will give them 3D movement of the object but online. Students use this online program to then download their project to upload the saved file to [Ultimaker](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura). Students should have downloaded this software to their computer. This application is called Cura. This is the program that talks to the 3D printer machine. For this technology, I am brainstorming to use peer instruction to have students collaborate with others about their progress. Using a 3D printer can be challenging at first because how it is viewed on paper, then computer software, and finally in 3D is different. With the steps being broken down and students providing feedback with their point of view or to speak out loud their thinking process can help those who are listening and speaking. This will help the auditory and visual learners by sharing their models and listening to the process of thinking among those in the same group as they collaborate. 
  
  Lastly, students will be using a [canvasworkspace](https://canvasworkspace.brother.com/en) to work with vinyl/adhesive cutter. They will use this to design products to bring awareness to local or worldwide issues. This vinyl cutter uses an online program to have students type and design logos and text to print out in either an adhesive medium or vinyl to then adhere to other cloth like material. This technology will be used as complimentary to lesson on world or local issues lesson. Students will be asked to think of an issue that is impacting their community. Then, students will be asked to make a propaganda to bring awareness to their community issue. Students could is the vinyl cutter to actually design their logo. Then, they could scan their design with the same machine and manipulate in the canvas workspace online software program. This is where they can decide if they would like to make stickers to pass out and bring awareness. It is also possible they can create other form of mediums to that are not limited to stickers to bring awareness. As this machine can cut, draw, and scan designs. Students will be working in groups to collaborate and come into a consensus on how to bring awareness. Students will be taught how to use this machine before hand the many task that it could be done with it beforehand. Many students have not seen a machine of this kind and would be exposed to be able to use it and produce what their imagination can provide. This would make it fun for students to create and see their creation come alive to serve a greater purpose. Finally, students will go out to the community and share their product and the school to see the impact of their work. 

### Impacts

This will help out students computer science implements critical thinking skills that students may not have or need help building on it. Students at my school do not have a lot of opportunities for trial an error. The first offense is taken and shut down. My students need multiple chances to make mistakes and speak their mind. Though it is difficult in a school system that castigates them for things that they were not taught otherwise. I know this new knowledge would be difficult and weird to them because it is not something they are use to doing. Even as an educator it will have be break out of my comfort level and actually let students lead their education. The only reason I don’t do this because I feel I won’t know how to lead them to where they want to go. I am not sure how to cultivate class resiliency. I am not even sure how that would even look like.

Students who were placed in this class are known as magnet students. These students have established themselves as hard working and independent when completing assignments. As I tried to implement pair programing. It was difficult for them to work with a partner because each of them want to be both navigator and driver. This is a challenge that I need to strategize for students to feel comfortable doing when asked to pair program. 

We are no longer in virtual learning at my school site. Though when we were because of the school lock down there was challenges such as weak internet connectivity and technology malfunction that could be out of the control of the household members. A teacher or school not help students out right away with these kinds of issues. It will continue be the issue because students in my school do not all have realiable internet and computer access. 

Misconceptions that some students struggle with is that it has to be about computers and some students are not comfortabl with computers. These students then keep to themselves and do not complete assignments. I have the challenge of modifying the lesson to be of interest to them to make it fun for them to engage in my computer science class. I plan to incorporate more engaging collaboration practices. Such as round robin, a kagan strategy, to give students time to share their learning and give feedback on each other learning progress and challenges. This is will alieave the amount of time on the computer and more time to collaborate with other students. 

Lastly, I plan to give student choices and this again are for students who have 0 percent interest in computer science because of the misconception that it is not fun. I could give multiple opportunities through the use of choice boards. Students will be presented the objective and then be presented with multiple ways this objective can be met but with their choice in mind.
